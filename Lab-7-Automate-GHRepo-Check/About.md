In this we will be writing Python script that interacts with the GH API, so that we can manage GH efficiently.

This script identifies all your GH Repo that haven't been modified in the last 30 days, allowing us to easily spot stale projects and clean up the account.

## Learning
1. How to authenticate with the GH API using a PAT (Personal Access Token)
2. The process of fetching your repo and checking theor last modified date.
3. Techniques to filter and display repo that need attention.

## Interact with GH
To interact with your git repo, you need to generate the PAT for authrntiation with git under the developer settings options and also your GH username is required.
