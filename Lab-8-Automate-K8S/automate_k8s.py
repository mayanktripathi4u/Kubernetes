# kubernetes: This is the official Python client library for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.
# pip install kubernetes
# client: This module provides access to the various Kubernetes APIs, allowing you to manage resources like pods, deployments, services, etc.
# config: This module is used to load your Kubernetes configuration (usually from a kubeconfig file) so that your script can authenticate and interact with the Kubernetes API.
# ApiException: This is a specific exception class provided by the Kubernetes client library. It is raised when there are errors during API calls (e.g., when trying to read a pod that doesnâ€™t exist or if there are permission issues). Catching this exception allows for better error handling in your code.

#  Purpose
# This try block attempts to delete a specific deployment in a given Kubernetes namespace using the Kubernetes API. If any errors occur during this operation, control will be transferred to the corresponding except block to handle those errors.

# Components Explained
# api_response =:
# This variable is assigned the result of the API call to delete the deployment. The response will typically contain information about the status of the deletion request.
# apps_v1.delete_namespaced_deployment(...):
# This is a method call to the delete_namespaced_deployment function of the apps_v1 client instance. This method specifically targets a deployment in a particular namespace for deletion.

# Parameters:

# name=name:
# This specifies the name of the deployment to be deleted. The name variable is expected to contain the name of the deployment that was passed to the delete_deployment function.
# namespace=namespace:
# This specifies the namespace where the deployment resides. The namespace variable should contain the namespace that was passed to the function.
# body=client.V1DeleteOptions(...):
# This parameter provides options for how the deletion should be handled. The V1DeleteOptions class is used to specify these options.
# client.V1DeleteOptions(...):

# This class is used to define deletion behavior for the resource.
# propagation_policy='Foreground':
# This option specifies how resources that depend on the deployment should be deleted.
# Foreground: The deletion will wait for the dependent resources (like pods) to be deleted first before deleting the deployment itself. This ensures that there is no abrupt termination of dependent resources.
# grace_period_seconds=5:
# This option sets a grace period for the deletion, giving resources time to shut down gracefully. In this case, it waits for 5 seconds before forcibly terminating any remaining resources related to the deployment.
